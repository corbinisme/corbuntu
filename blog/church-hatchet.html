  <p>Several years ago I was listening to a song titled, “Which to Bury; Us or the Hatchet?”</p>
  <p>I had heard the phrase “bury the hatchet” before but had never really   thought about what it meant. To “bury the hatchet” with someone these   days means that two individuals or groups try to put away the bitter   past, release all grudges and move on with forgiveness and friendship.</p>
  <p>This phrase originated with the Native Americans in a similar   context, only with warring tribes. Upon a settlement of conflict, the   chiefs would both literally bury a hatchet as a symbol of their promise   of peace. The hatchet symbolized the grudge or yearning for vengeance   that we as humans often hold when we cannot or will not forgive one   another.<img src="http://www.verticalthought.org/issues/vt18/images/pc_hatchet.jpg" alt="hatchet" align="right" /></p>
  <p>We all have our hatchets—grudges, conflicts, hurts and bitterness—at   times in this life (and if not, then well done!). If you’re like me, you   don’t often want to bury your hurt feelings—you want revenge!</p>
  <p>The trouble with human nature and the carnal or sinfully selfish mind   is that even when we try to bury the hatchet, we don’t often bury it   completely. Sometimes we leave the handle sticking out of the   ground—just in case. If that handle still sticks out in plain sight,   when moments of weakness or bitterness occur. we will likely pull that   weapon up to continue fighting our emotional war. Though we think that   we can axe our way to happiness, we will only hurt ourselves and others   in the long run.</p>
  <p>Why is it so hard for us to let things go? Our culture certainly   doesn’t help. Some of the top pop culture songs have told us we have a   right to be upset, shouldn’t let things go and that the world is against   us.</p>
  <p>“What Goes Around Comes Around” is a song about a man getting   satisfaction from watching a woman who hurt him get hurt in a similar   manner. The recent song “Apologize” declares in the chorus, “It’s too   late to apologize.” These songs don’t leave room for the thought of   burying the hatchet because they are so full of anger, hurt and the   relentless pursuit of revenge to satisfy grudges.</p>
  <p>Why should it have to be “too late to apologize”?</p>
  <p>Our kind Creator teaches that it’s not too late. He not only tells us   to forgive others as He forgives us, but He also tells us how to bury   the hatchet.</p>
  <p>First, Jesus said, “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him   his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained   your brother” (Matthew 18:15). Just privately, calmly talk it out—how   good is that!</p>
  <p>Finally, don’t let the sun go down on your wrath. Letting things boil   up inside only compounds the anger until it feels too late to apologize   and bury that hatchet!</p>

  <p>To have better, stronger friendships and family bonds—and a lot more   joy in your life—dig a deep hole and bury the hatchet completely!</p>
