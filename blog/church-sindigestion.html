  <p><strong>sindigestion</strong> (sin-di-gest’chen, n.) <em>An   uncomfortable condition due to difficulty or an inability to process or   digest things not fit for healthy spiritual digestion.</em></p>
  <p><img src="http://www.verticalthought.org/issues/vt16/images/icon_arrowgrey.gif" alt="sin" align="left" />You   roll over in bed, still sick to your stomach, hoping the pain will soon   subside. You’ve already tried to curl up into the smallest possible   ball to alleviate the discomfort, but you just can’t bend any further.   Groaning, you realize that your decision to eat the moldy pizza and two   cans of Cheese Whiz may not have been the best idea after all! Yes,   you’ve got indigestion, and it’s definitely not fun.</p>
  <p>Much like the feeling of indigestion, we are susceptible to the   negative consequences of bad choices we make in our lives.   “Sindigestion” is the unsettling state we find ourselves in when we   ingest too much of this present evil world’s influence. When we allow   too much negativity into our minds or focus too much on our own selfish   interests, we can become spiritually ill. <img src="http://www.verticalthought.org/issues/vt16/images/pc_sindigestion.jpg" alt="digestion" align="right" /></p>
  <p>God designed us to be happy and healthy if we take in the right kind   of things. But when we dump garbage into our bodies and our minds, we   simply won’t function at 100 percent.</p>
  <p>We all have some spiritual sindigestion in our lives. As with   indigestion, our spiritual aliment can come from many sources, like   overindulging on spiritual junk food, bad films or violent video games.   Here’s how to be sindigestion-free over the long haul:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a steady diet of positive food for thought. Focus on the   good things in life. Limit or tune out the negative, sinful ideas and   examples so rampant in our media and society. Sin clogs us up inside and   makes us sick. Just as we endeavor to avoid junk foods, we should focus   our minds on true and noble thoughts. Develop a desire for what is good   and upright, rather than for what seems popular and entertaining, yet   is sinful (Philippians 4:8).</li>
    <li>Stay active in your godly behavior. Once you’ve limited your   negative intake, internalize the positive things of God by acting on   them in your life. Our physical bodies need good food and exercise to   burn off the negative junk inside of us. True spiritual health demands   that we be doers of God’s Word, not just hearers (James 1:22).</li>
    <li>Rest, recuperate, repeat. One of the most common remedies for   sickness is rest. Our bodies need a break from all this processing to   regenerate. Luckily for us, God has built in a day each week for us to   rest so we can stay spiritually healthy. While we rest, our bodies and   minds rejuvenate so we can be in top shape, free of sindigestion, ready   to start the cycle over again. God made us and knows that we need this   resting period—the Sabbath was made for mankind! (Mark 2:27).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each step builds spiritual health. But even if you try to tune out   the negative, there is that yucky (yes, yucky!), sinful nature within   that can still make you sick. To beat sindigestion, actively replace the   wrong mind-set with things from above—the things of God!
