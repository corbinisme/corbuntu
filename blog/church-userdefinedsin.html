<p>Wikipedia.org is a popular Internet reference destination today. It’s   an online, user-edited encyclopedia available in 14 languages,   completely free and open to the discretion of people who hopefully know   what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Articles can be submitted by almost anyone and changed by almost   anyone as well. If something is put up that someone labels as incorrect,   it can be quickly flagged and taken down. Wikipedia cannot, however,   guarantee the factual nature of any of the content on the site. Despite   this, millions of people use it to seek definitions for various words   and concepts. After all, if millions of people believe it, it has to be   true, right?<img src="http://www.verticalthought.org/issues/vt15/images/pc_sin.jpg" alt="user" align="right" /></p>
<p>Not necessarily. Ironically, we live in a world where billions of   people live their lives without ever believing that the wonderful Maker   of the whole universe even exists. More ironically, even among people   who do openly profess their belief in a supreme Creator, there is a   common misperception about right and wrong. Most don’t know how to   define what sin is.</p>
<p>Looking at my native America as an example, I see some similarities   to Wikipedia. America is a fast-paced, ever-changing place that is   always seeking further worldly knowledge and advancement. It also allows   its social norms to dictate its conceptions of sin and morality. Like   Wikipedia’s definitions, those perceptions can easily be changed and   edited by those around us. America, like the rest of the world, does not   consider that there is an ultimate moral authority. So humanity defines   its own degrees of sin and morality and allows the views of others to   alter those definitions over time.</p>
<p>Does this mean that our age is more enlightened and better prepared   to know right from wrong? Hardly. Some form of the “enlightened crowd”   has existed in every era, and obviously the human race still hasn’t   quite gotten it right.</p>
<p>There are absolutes! But in a world where everything is seemingly   relative, no absolutes are accepted. This mind-set affects people in   every walk of life. For example, much of professing Christianity judges   some sins much more severely than others. With recent controversies   about homosexuality, some vocal believers are strident about this one   sin yet are strangely accepting of other sins like sex before marriage,   adultery, lying and dishonoring parents.</p>
<p>Many people think that God is tolerant and view the Ten Commandments   as suggestions—thinking that it doesn’t matter if we break them now and   again, since He will forgive us anyway. However God set rules for us   that are permanent and unchanging, and the penalty for breaking this law   is death (Romans 6:23). God takes sin so seriously, that He still   requires death—either ours or Jesus Christ’s. When we want to change and   ask for forgiveness, Christ is willing to pay that penalty for us, and   God is merciful to forgive us.</p>
<p>In a wanton society, those of us seeking to follow the one true God   need to realize that God’s way of life is not user defined—there is no   spiritual Wikipedia of sin. God has a book already written to guide our   lives. To learn more about this incredible book, download or request the   free booklet Is the Bible True? In short, the Bible teaches the way of   life that will be for our benefit and happiness—forever! VT</p>
